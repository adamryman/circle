# circle

The golang `image.Image` interface is cool.

```
godoc image Image
```

This is just a small example to show how you can implement the image interface.

```
go get github.com/adamryman/circle/circle-png
circle-png
```

This will create a file `output.png` with a circle. Try:
```
circle-png -h
```
